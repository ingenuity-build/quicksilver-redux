        Governance by Proxy will allow users to retain their voting rights when liquid staking their assets, and continue participating in network governance while staking assets through the Protocol.

        This feature will prevent the concentration of governance power within select few actors by maintaining the communityâ€™s voice. The Quicksilver team believes that active governance is key to a healthy and functioning ecosystem, thus, it is of the highest importance that Quicksilver users continue to benefit from governance rights while holding liquid staked assets.
